 *
 * The Legend of Zelda is a top-down dungeon crawler where the player
 * controls a sword and shield wielding character named Link. The games
 * in this series generally all include elements of puzzles, action,
 * adventure, and exploration. Over the course of the game, Link will
 * acquire various items and upgrades that he can use to defeat enemies
 * and solve puzzles. The first game in the series was released in 1986
 * on Nintendo's Famicom Disk System and was revolutionary for its time.
 * It is widely considered to be one of the best game franchises to date.
